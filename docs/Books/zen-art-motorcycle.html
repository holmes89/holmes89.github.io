<li>"It's not the motorcycle maintenance, not the faucet. It's all of the technology they can't take."</li>
<li>People can't seem to handle or want to be involved with the technology they are using. This goes for people who avoid becoming knowledgable in a particular area. I'm not interested in learning x because I will never need to do x. Or x technology is outside of my area.</li>
<li>Developers should not impose self ignorance.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After talking about inept repairmen on his motorcycle: "Why did they butcher it so? These were not people running away from technology&#x2026; these were technologies themselves. They sat down to do a job and they performed it like chimpanzees. Nothing personal in it. There was no obvious reason for it."</li>
<li>Lack of interest in their work. Lack of thinking or investment in their profession.</li>
<li>Issues that were noticed:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not thinking (listening to music) "You can't really think hard about what you're doing and listen to the radio"</li>
<li>Speed - Sloppy work for more money</li>
<li>No identification with the job - "No saying, 'I'm a mechanic'. - No after work thinking about their work.</li>
<li>Detachment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things"</li>
