* Overview of the Idea
Use Redis [[https://redis.io/topics/protocol][Protocol]] as the basis in creating a distributed system written in Go. I plan on using [[https://github.com/boltdb/bolt][boltdb]] as the underlying KV store.

* Things to Learn

- Managing protobuf with Bazel
- Distributed system development
